John Dunham 10-4-12:
    Added fileOps/fileOperator.js:
        Implemented the file output code (takes in a string and generates a file that is then presented for download)
        Implemented the drag and drop feature as well as a basic file Input analyzer.
    TODO:
        Pin down the rubixCube.js data structure and have the input be converted to that.
    Notes:
        The output of the first half can be formatted as JSON in a txt file.
        For the table we can use a number to represent the key using the binary form
            (hashing might be nice, but I'm not sure if that structure exosts in javascript)
